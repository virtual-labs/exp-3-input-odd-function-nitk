        "a": "Only one line is faulty",
        "b": "The faulty line is parmanenetly set to 0 or 1",

        "d": "A single stuck-at fault model assumes only one fault at a time, with the affected line fixed at logic 0 or 1. This fault can be located at any node in the circuit—before or after logic gates—making it a widely used fault model in digital testing."
