Theory
A fault model is an engineering model of something that could go wrong in the construction or operation of a piece of equipment, A stuck-at fault is a particular fault model used by fault simulators, Individual signals and pins are assumed to be stuck at Logical '1', '0' . For example, an input is tied to a logical 1 state during test generation to assure that a manufacturing defect with that type of behaviour can be found with a specific test pattern. The even function is equal to 1 when the number of 1’s in the input combination is even.

The complement of an odd function is an even function. The complement of an odd function (an even function) is obtained by replacing the output gate with an Exclusive-NOR gate


Combinational circuit is a circuit in which we combine the different gates in the circuit, for example encoder, decoder, multiplexer and demultiplexer. Some of the characteristics of combinational circuits are following −

1. The output of combinational circuit at any instant of time, depends only on the levels present at input terminals.

2. The combinational circuit do not use any memory. The previous state of input does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit.

3. A combinational circuit can have an n number of inputs and m number of outputs.

Terminology -
1.Minimal Terms : Minimal expression for a logic function is the one that has the least possible number of terms and also the least possible total number of literals.

2.Disjunctive normal form : Disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a canonical normal form of a logical formula consisting of a disjunction of conjunctions; it can also be described as an OR of ANDs, a sum of products, or (in philosophical logic) a cluster concept.

3.Conjuctive normal form: Conjunctive normal form (CNF) is an approach to Boolean logic that expresses formulas as conjunctions of clauses with an AND or OR. Each clause connected by a conjunction, or AND, must be either a literal or contain a disjunction, or OR operator.

4.Venn diagram : A Venn diagram is an illustration that uses circles to show the relationships among things or finite groups of things. Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not share those traits.
